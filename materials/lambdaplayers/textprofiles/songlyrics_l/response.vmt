when im lying close to someone else youre stuck in my head
i only know how to go too far
dont know who you think that youre confusing
i think he knows
it aint me
so we back in the mine
wait i couldve really liked you
but i cant help it i got issues i cant help it baby
whats wrong with being confident uh huh huh
why you always in a mood
you need to calm down youre being too loud
cause i dont care when im with my baby yeah
he said are you serious
i cant i cant
got no way to prove it so maybe im lying
you dont mess with love you mess with the truth
thats that me espresso
oh its a set up its a set up its a set up
every time you come around you know i cant say no
