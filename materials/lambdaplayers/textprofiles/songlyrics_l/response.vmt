when im lying close to someone else youre stuck in my head
i only know how to go too far
dont know who you think that youre confusing
i think he knows
it aint me
so we back in the mine
wait i couldve really liked you
but i cant help it i got issues i cant help it baby
whats wrong with being confident uh huh huh
why you always in a mood
you need to calm down youre being too loud
cause i dont care when im with my baby yeah
he said are you serious
i cant i cant
got no way to prove it so maybe im lying
you dont mess with love you mess with the truth
thats that me espresso
oh its a set up its a set up its a set up
every time you come around you know i cant say no
because i aint a hater like you
because we aint no haters like you
cause i already got a good thing with me
just a feeling ive got like somethings about to happen but i dont know what
if that means what i think it means were in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say im not taking any chances
im really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
thats just the way it is things will never be the same
thats just the way it is aw yeah
lucky for you thats what i like
hey looking boy what you say looking boy?
i dont know everything
you are somebody that we dont know but youre coming at my friends like a missile
why are you mad when you can be glad?
i dont care i love it
i could give a thousand reasons why
cause im always repping for that low life
thats not who we are
he tried to break my heart? oh that breaks my heart
dont say sorry everyones watching
you can find me in the club
cause you had your chance and you blew it
no i aint got nothing to smile about
talk that talk baby
i guess we would have to walk a mile in each others shoes at least
just keep breathin and breathin and breathin and breathiiiiiiiin
you got me misunderstood but at least i look this good
well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
just cause i put away the sawed off?
sometimes your words just hypnotize me
you can get anything you want you know what im saying?
