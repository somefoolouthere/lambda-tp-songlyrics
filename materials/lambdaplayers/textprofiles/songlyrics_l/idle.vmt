you got a couple of ghost writers but to these kids it dont actually matter

some people got the real problems
trying not to adopt my fathers old philosophies
|alone|hello from the other siiiiiiiiiiiide
so im picking it up im picking it up
now im grown i know what i deserve
i dont know how or why or when i ended up being in this position im in
whos waking up to drive you home when youre drunk and all alone
im gonna get in my car
you think you know somebody
im gonna run away now and never look back
i dont even really know what you intended
ive always been told one day ill find somebody who changes my mind
i know shes been asleep on my side of your bed
we were high and we were sober
i was up late night balling
im friends with the monster the son in my bed
just one hit and you will know ill never be the same
you can take me home you can never let me go
i got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone
i dont like nobody but you i hate everyone here
the clock stopped ticking forever ago
i cant get a grip but i cant let go
why cant i see why cant i see all the colors that you see
please can i be please can i be colorful and free
im a sucker for you
|alone||pmtime|i dont wanna spend the night aloooone
if she catch me cheating i will never tell her sorry
its time for me to take it
so far from my past misfortune
theres nothing left to say so i shut my mouth
i know you love me i know its crazy
im over here doing what i like
why im switching faster than the channels on tv?
im black then im white no something isnt right
we were young and now im older
the trembling fear is more than i can take when im up against the echo in the mirror
you could break my heart in two but when it heals it beats for you
you can find me in the club
then only for a minute i want to change my mind cause this just dont feel right to me
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
broke down and built myself back together again
theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
aint got no tears left to cry
we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip them dont expect no help
they not like us
i just poured something in my cup
swearing this will be the last but it probably wont
she thought it was the ocean its just a pool
it aint even worth dissing someone so off beat that they cant even figure out where their words should hit the kick and the snare
think about what you believe in now
we cant be friends
work work work work work work
yeah i just wanna dance with the illusion
i make elevating music you make elevator music
|crowded|im at a party i dont wanna be at
|crowded|dont think i fit in at this party
mama said dont give up
feels like a close its coming to
i cant have what i want and neither can you
i am unwritten cant read my mind
you want that over there? got you
you can get anything you want you know what im saying?
got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play
|pmtime|the sun is down freezing cold
stupid boy making me so sad
snap back to reality
oh there goes gravity
ive been running through the jungle ive been running with the wolves to get to you
its funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me
i guess freedom didnt feel like you thought
last time i checked youre the one that left
im just a symbol to remind you that theres more to see
i come and i go
you can take it hot to go
we were lovers for the first time running all the red lights
we were lovers on a wild ride speeding for the finish line
i keep a record of the wreckage in my life
i gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
im drunk in the back of the car and i cried like a baby coming home from the bar
you keep calling you keep calling saying that you want it back
shes got everything that i dont have
just wanna let this story die and ill be alright
you know youre good when you can even do it with a broken heart
am i someone you cannot live without
10 dollars was a fat stack
im so depressed i act like its my birthday every day
when im lying close to someone else youre stuck in my head and i can get you out of it if i could do it all again
i know we meant all good intentions
nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say but nothing comes out when they move their lips
oh we gotta turn up the crazy
welcome to the new age
i moved out of the hood for good you blame me
aint nothing but a gangsta party
