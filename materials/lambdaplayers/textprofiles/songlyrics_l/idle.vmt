so far from my past misfortune
theres nothing left to say so i shut my mouth
i know you love me i know its crazy
im over here doing what i like
why im switching faster than the channels on tv?
im black then im white no something isnt right
we were young and now im older
the trembling fear is more than i can take when im up against the echo in the mirror
you could break my heart in two but when it heals it beats for you
you can find me in the club
then only for a minute i want to change my mind cause this just dont feel right to me
wish we could turn back time to the good old days
broke down and built myself back together again
theres a hope thats waiting for you in the dark
aint got no tears left to cry
we gotta take these cards ourselves and flip them dont expect no help
