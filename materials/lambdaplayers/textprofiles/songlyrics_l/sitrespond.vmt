i only know how to go too far
but i cant help it i got issues i cant help it baby
why you always in a mood
i know what i came to do and that aint gonna change
you need to calm down youre being too loud
im only human after all dont put the blame on me
im only human made mistakes im only human thats all it takes to put the blame on me
and yeah i know how bad it must hurt to see me like this but it gets worse
baby i aint playing by your rules
dont put your blame on me
i got nothing left to lose or use or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes staring in space and i know i lose control of the things that i say
being so bad got me feeling so good
dont put the blame on me
how did we get into this mess got so aggressive
i dont care i love it
i could give a thousand reasons why
talk that talk baby
swearing this will be the last but it probably wont
you got me misunderstood but at least i look this good
the cabinets are bare and im unaware of just how we got into this mess got so aggressive
i could give a million reasons why
