We wish you a merry christmas, we wish you a merry christmas
The world is mine

Now count it 5, 10
I'd have to shovel dirt and dig a hole to get on yours you bum bum
My pencil get killed
Ah! Ah! You caint c meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Get my migo on the phone
Bow down when you come to our town
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I feel like godzilla. Better hit the deck like the card dealer.
This is where I wanna be
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
We gon be alright
I tried to show em
Knock knock, let the devil in
Something's wrong, I can feel it
If it's a dream don't wake me
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else you're stuck in my head
My bad habits lead to you.
Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before.
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames.
I'm so sick of that same old love.
Yeah, get the money. Throw it in the furnace.
I know I'd go back to you.
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster.
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn into a monster.
Every pure intention ends when the good times start.
I only know how to go too far.
We took the long way round.
So you say I'm complicated.
Creeper? Aww man.
People I used to know, just don't know me no more.
Everywhere that I go, I got people I know.
All you have to do is stay.
I wanna be that guy.
Ooh, what you doing?
I think he knows
So we back in the mine
Did I fall off?
Got you in your room ripping every Chronic poster on your wall off? Just cause I put away the sawed off?
20/20 vision won't visualize!
Always changing your access codes.
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Had to have high high hopes for a living.
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body cloooooose to me
But my heart don't understand why I got you on my mind.
All my people from the front to the back nod
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I had a dream, we were back to 17.
Focus on me!
I know what I came to do, and that ain't gonna change
Some days, things just take way too much of my energy.
I love you, it's ruining my life.
I'm so obsessed with your ex.
Lately I've been feeling so cool.
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me.
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Take that money, watch it burn.
Did you think that I would let you, crawl right back into my bedroom, after everything we've been through?
The middle finger was a peace sign, yeah.
Was a time when I just threw a match and let it burn.
You ain't my boyfriend, and I ain't your girlfriend.
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't.
How long have I been up, I don't know.
Hold me up, tie me down. Cause I never wanna leave your side.
If I told you how much I think about her you'd think I was in love.
I look up and the whole room's spinning.
I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about.
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it. Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it.
Me and my truth, we sit in silence.
That's what they're yelling. It's not about a salary, it's all about reality.
Little ghetto boooooooooooy, playing the ghetto streeeeeeeeet. What you gonna do when you grow up?
She's talented, she's good with kids, she even speaks kindly about me.
I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black.
I'd do it all again.
I'm gonna get in my car. I'm gonna drive real fast, but wherever I go, things like trouble will find me, yeah.
You can never come too close for comfort.
I can deal with the bad nights, when I'm with my baby yeah.
You are somebody that I don't know
Welcome to my house.
I want you to know, that it's our time.
A chair in the corner is my place I stay.
I'm losing my mind just a little.
Oh it's a set up, it's a set up, it's a set up
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy.
It starts with
It starts with one thing, I don't know why.
I pose and take pictures, then send them to people that I don't know.
I want you out in the pouring rain. I want you down on your knees
