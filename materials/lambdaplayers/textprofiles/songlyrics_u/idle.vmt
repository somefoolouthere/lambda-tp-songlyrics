B-b-b-bad to the bone!
Never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down.
|christmas|We wish you a merry christmas. We wish you a merry christmas
We wish you a merry christmas. We wish you a merry christmas
The world is mine
Ay, it's a holiday.
|christmas|Ay, it's a holiday.
Now count it 5, 10
I'd have to shovel dirt and dig a hole to get on yours you bum bum.
My pencil get killed
Ah! Ah! You caint c meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Get my migo on the phone
Bow down when you come to our town
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like godzilla. Better hit the deck like the card dealer.
This is where I wanna be
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
We gon be alright.
I tried to show em.
Knock knock, let the devil in
Something's wrong, I can feel it.
If it's a dream don't wake me.
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to.
When I'm lying close to someone else you're stuck in my head
My bad habits lead to you.
Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before.
So it's gonna be forever, or it's gonna go down in flames.
I'm so sick of that same old love.
Yeah, get the money. Throw it in the furnace.
I know I'd go back to you.
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster.
I'm normal during the day, but at night turn into a monster.
Every pure intention ends when the good times start.
I only know how to go too far.
We took the long way round.
So you say I'm complicated
Creeper? Aww man.
People I used to know, just don't know me no more.
Everywhere that I go, I got people I know.
All you have to do is stay.
I wanna be that guy.
Ooh, what you doing?
I think he knows
So we back in the mine
Did I fall off?
Got you in your room ripping every Chronic poster on your wall off? Just cause I put away the sawed off?
20/20 vision won't visualize!
Always changing your access codes.
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning?
Had to have high high hopes for a living.
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body cloooooose to me
But my heart don't understand why I got you on my mind.
All my people from the front to the back nod
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I had a dream, we were back to 17.
Focus on me!
I know what I came to do, and that ain't gonna change
Some days, things just take way too much of my energy.
And I love you, it's ruining my life.
I'm so obsessed with your ex.
Lately I've been feeling so cool.
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me.
Lately I've been I've been losing sleep
Take that money, watch it burn.
Did you think that I would let you, crawl right back into my bedroom, after everything we've been through?
The middle finger was a peace sign, yeah.
Was a time when I just threw a match and let it burn.
You ain't my boyfriend, and I ain't your girlfriend
I've been hoping somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't.
How long have I been up, I don't know.
Hold me up, tie me down. Cause I never wanna leave your side.
If I told you how much I think about her you'd think I was in love
I look up and the whole room's spinning.
I've been next to you all night and still don't know what you're about.
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?
Twist it, twist it, twist it, twist it. Mix it and mix it and mix it and mix it.
Me and my truth, we sit in silence.
That's what they're yelling. It's not about a salary, it's all about reality.
Little ghetto boooooooooooy, playing the ghetto streeeeeeeeet. What you gonna do when you grow up?
She's talented, she's good with kids, she even speaks kindly about me.
I'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black.
I'd do it all again.
I'm gonna get in my car. I'm gonna drive real fast, but wherever I go, things like trouble will find me, yeah.
You can never come too close for comfort.
I can deal with the bad nights, when I'm with my baby yeah.
You are somebody that I don't know
Welcome to my house.
I want you to know, that it's our time.
A chair in the corner is my place I stay.
I'm losing my mind just a little.
Oh it's a set up, it's a set up, it's a set up
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy.
It starts with
It starts with one thing, I don't know why.
I pose and take pictures, then send them to people that I don't know.
I want you out in the pouring rain. I want you down on your knees
Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings, but I'm only going to get this one chance.
You got a couple of ghost writers, but to these kids it don't actually matter.
Listen, I've been tryna get it all.
I stack chips, you barely got a half eaten cheeto.
Some people got the real problems.
Trying not to adopt my father's old philosophies.
|alone|Hello from the other siiiiiiiiiiiide.
So, I'm picking it up, picking it up.
Now I'm grown, I know what I deserve
I don't know how or why or when I ended up being in this position I'm in.
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
I'm gonna get in my car
You think you know somebody.
I'm gonna run away now, and never look back.
I don't even really know what you intended.
I've always been told one day I'll find somebody who changes my mind.
I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed
We were high and we were sober.
I was up late night balling.
I'm friends with the monster, the son in my bed.
Just one hit and you will know I'll never be the same.
You can take me home. You can never let me go.
I got this feeling on a summer day when you were gone.
I don't like nobody but you. I hate everyone here.
The clock stopped ticking forever ago.
I can't get a grip, but I can't let go.
Why can't I see, why can't I see, all the colors that you see?
Please can I be, please can I be, colorful and free?
I'm a sucker for you.
|alone||pmtime|I don't wanna spend the night aloooone.
If she catch me cheating I will never tell her sorry.
It's time for me to take it.
So far from my past misfortune.
There's nothing left to say, so I shut my mouth
I know you love me. I know it's crazy
I'm over here doing what I like.
Why I'm switching faster than the channels on TV?
I'm black, then I'm white. No, something isn't right.
We were young and now I'm older
The trembling fear is more than I can take when I'm up against the echo in the mirror.
You could break my heart in two, but when it heals it beats for you.
You can find me in the club.
Then only for a minute, I want to change my mind cause, this just don't feel right to me.
Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
Broke down and built myself back together again.
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark.
Ain't got no tears left to cry
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip them, don't expect no help.
They not like us.
I just poured something in my cup.
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won't.
She thought it was the ocean, it's just a pool.
It ain't even worth dissing someone so off beat that they can't even figure out where their words should hit the kick and the snare.
Think about what you believe in now.
We, can't, be friends
Work work work work work work.
Yeah I just wanna dance with the illusion.
I make elevating music, you make elevator music.
|crowded|I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
|crowded|Don't think I fit in at this party.
Mama said, don't give up.
Feels like a close, it's coming to.
I can't have what I want, but neither can you.
I am unwritten. Can't read my mind.
You want that over there? Got you.
You can get anything you want. You know what I'm saying?
Got on the bus, put my headphones on, and pressed play.
|pmtime|The sun is down, freezing cold.
Stupid boy making me so sad.
Snap back to reality.
Oh, there goes gravity.
I've been running through the jungle. I've been running with the wolves to get to you.
It's funny how you miss me more than you could ever love me.
I guess freedom didn't feel like you thought.
Last time I checked, you're the one that left.
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see.
I come and I go.
You can take it hot to go.
We were lovers for the first time, running all the red lights.
We were lovers on a wild ride, speeding for the finish line.
I keep a record of the wreckage in my life.
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind.
I'm drunk in the back of the car, and I cried like a baby coming home from the bar.
You keep calling, you keep calling, saying that you want it back.
She's got everything that I don't have.
Just wanna let this story die, and I'll be alright.
You know you're good when you can even do it, with a broken heart.
Am I someone you cannot live without?
10 dollars was a fat stack.
I'm so depressed I act like it's my birthday, every day.
When I'm lying close to someone else you're stuck in my head, and I can get you out of it, if I could do it all again.
I know we meant all good intentions.
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say, but nothing comes out when they move their lips.
Oh, we gotta turn up the crazy.
Welcome to the new age
I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me.
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party.
Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you.
I'm so obsessed with him but he avoids me, like the plague.
I wanna know the truth.
Started off as a wildfire, burning down the bridges to our empire.
I'm over here working day and night
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control.
You, know, I, got, what it takes to make the club go outta control.
We were sipping on emotion, smoking and inhaling every moment.
I'm out of sight. Now I'm out of they dang reach.
Right before your very eyes, you won't even visualize!
Must see my enemies defeated.
I'm sorry. The old /self/ can't come to the phone right now.
You got people they know, so I suggest you lay low.
All the bad things disappear, and you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody.
The clock, is ticking, so stay.
I've never been the best at letting go.
Switch it up like Nintendo.
We are not beautiful.
Picket white fence, but we paint it black.
Waiting for the time to pass you by.
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Why do I compare myself to everyone?
When my well was dry, I was still making my wishes.
They say I come and I go.
Took a few years to soak up the tears, but look at her now.
And I always got my finger on the self destruct.
Roaches everywhere like we forgot to take the trash out.
It's funny, I was going crazy not too long ago.
I know that you're still self obsessed.
I wish that I could say I'm proud.
Cause I'm a black belt when I'm beating up on myself, but I'm an expert at giving love to somebody else.
Flipping through all of these magazines, telling me who I'm supposed to be.
Every time you dance with somebody, I want you to feel me.
Things just ain't the same for gangstas.
Can't see what I am, I just see what I'm not.
There's vomit on his sweater already. Mom's spaghetti.
I'm, guilty bout everything that I eat.
