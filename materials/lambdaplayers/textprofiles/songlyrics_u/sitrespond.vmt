I only know how to go too far.
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it baby.
Why you always in a mood?
I know what I came to do, and that ain't gonna change
You need to calm down. You're being too loud.
I'm only human after all. Don't put the blame on me.
I'm only human, made mistakes. I'm only human, that's all it takes to put the blame on me.
And yeah I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this but it gets worse.
Baby I ain't playing by your rules.
Don't put your blame on me.
I got nothing left to lose, or use, or do.
My bad habits lead to wide eyes staring in space, and I know I lose control of the things that I say.
Being so bad got me feeling so good.
Don't put the blame on me.
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive.
I don't care. I love it.
I could give a thousand reasons why
Talk that talk baby.
Swearing this will be the last, but it probably won't.
You got me misunderstood but at least I look this good.
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware of just how we got into this mess. Got so aggressive.
I could give a million reasons why
