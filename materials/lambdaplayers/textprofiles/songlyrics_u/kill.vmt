You know the rules, and so do I.
Oh the misery... Everybody wants to be my enemyyyy
Bow down when you come to our town
Pray you see tomorrow little boy you gon' learn.
I'm not afraid, to take a stand.
Run up, and I'ma serve you heat.
I will not fall. I will stand tall.
I'm gonna run away now, and never look back.
|pmtime|Tonight we are victorious.
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Must see my enemies defeated.
Now I'm out here looking like revenge
