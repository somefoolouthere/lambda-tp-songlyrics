When I'm lying close to someone else you're stuck in my head
I only know how to go too far.
Don't know who you think that you're confusing
I think he knows
It ain't me.
So we back in the mine
Wait. I could've really liked you.
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it baby.
What's wrong with being confident? Uh huh huh.
Why you always in a mood?
You need to calm down. You're being too loud.
