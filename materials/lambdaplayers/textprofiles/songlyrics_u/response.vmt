When I'm lying close to someone else you're stuck in my head
I only know how to go too far.
Don't know who you think that you're confusing
I think he knows
It ain't me.
So we back in the mine
Wait. I could've really liked you.
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it baby.
What's wrong with being confident? Uh huh huh.
Why you always in a mood?
You need to calm down. You're being too loud.
Cause I don't care, when I'm with my baby yeah.
He said "Are you serious?"
I can't. I can't.
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying.
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
That's that me espresso.
Oh it's a set up, it's a set up, it's a set up
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no.
Because I ain't a hater like you.
Because we ain't no haters like you.
Cause I already got a good thing with me.
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble, and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances!
I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack.
That's just the way it is. Things will never be the same.
That's just the way it is, aw yeah.
Lucky for you that's what I like.
Hey looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I don't know everything
You are somebody that we don't know, but you're coming at my friends like a missile.
Why are you mad, when you can be glad?
I don't care. I love it.
I could give a thousand reasons why
Cause I'm always repping for that low life
That's not who we are.
He tried to break my heart? Oh that breaks my heart
Don't say sorry, everyone's watching.
You can find me in the club.
Cause you had your chance and you blew it.
No I ain't got nothing to smile about.
Talk that talk baby.
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least.
Just keep breathin and breathin and breathin and breathiiiiiiiin.
You got me misunderstood but at least I look this good.
Well that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it.
Just cause I put away the sawed off?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
You can get anything you want. You know what I'm saying?
