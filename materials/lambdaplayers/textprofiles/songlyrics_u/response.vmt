When I'm lying close to someone else you're stuck in my head
I only know how to go too far.
Don't know who you think that you're confusing
I think he knows
It ain't me.
So we back in the mine
Wait. I could've really liked you.
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it baby.
What's wrong with being confident? Uh huh huh.
Why you always in a mood?
You need to calm down. You're being too loud.
Cause I don't care, when I'm with my baby yeah.
He said "Are you serious?"
I can't. I can't.
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying.
You don't mess with love, you mess with the truth
That's that me espresso.
Oh it's a set up, it's a set up, it's a set up
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no.
Because I ain't a hater like you.
Because we ain't no haters like you.
Cause I already got a good thing with me.
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble, and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances!
I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack.
