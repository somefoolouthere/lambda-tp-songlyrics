Oh the misery... Everybody wants to be my enemyyyy
My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight.
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive.
Can't we just talk?
Mama said, don't give up.
I'm sorry that I let you down.
The cabinets are bare, and I'm unaware of just how we got into this mess. Got so aggressive.
